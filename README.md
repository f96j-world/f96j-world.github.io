# f96j-world.github.io â€” Starter

This is a minimal Jekyll site for GitHub Pages.

## How to publish
1. Create a repository named `f96j-world.github.io` on your GitHub account.
2. Upload these files/folders to the repo root:
   - `_config.yml`
   - `index.md`
   - `assets/headshot.jpg`
3. Commit. GitHub Pages will publish at: https://f96j-world.github.io/

## Customizing
- Edit `index.md` to update text and add project links/thumbnails.
- Replace `assets/headshot.jpg` with your preferred headshot variant.
- (Optional) Add a custom domain later by adding a `CNAME` file and pointing DNS to GitHub Pages.

## Tips
- Keep thumbnails under ~300KB for fast loads.
- Use unlisted YouTube/Vimeo or Google Drive links for videos.
